Bachelor on Information systems, i am a fullstack dev, always looking to learn the lastest technologies available and see what are the pros and cons of each, so i can understand why and what they are good for, doing this i am "always" going to be prepare to a new situation that i will face up.

Currently working as a frontend developer but on the day to day routine i have to be able to read, debug and change code on different languages, also as any other developer, some DEVOPS tasks as well. There i'm willing to learn everything i can, having experiences with different programming languages, systems architechtures and programming best practices.

My main focus when i am coding is to create user readable code and functional without any performance compromise.

## OSS Contributions

### Reakit

[http://github.com/reakit/reakit](http://github.com/reakit/reakit)

React ui Framework designed to be styled and composable

I contributed helping converting the whole project to typescript (around 80% of the components). Which helped me get better using a type system. I also had the opportunity to create a codemod using jscodeshift to help converting from one version that had breaking changes to the other one.

### webpack-cli

[http://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli](http://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli)

Cli to work with webpack

I was able to help updating some AST transformers they had to also help during migrations on versions that had major changes.

### webpack-plugin-serve

[http://github.com/shellscape/webpack-plugin-serve](http://github.com/shellscape/webpack-plugin-serve)

Webpack development serve

Helped start the project, i was able to create some critical features that are available right now. Also the project helped me learn more about websocket and how webpack hooks actually works.

### webpack-nano

A simple CLI, built to have the basics and just work with webpack.
