Bachelor on Information systems, i am a fullstack dev, always looking to learn the lastest technologies available and see what are the pros and cons of each, so i can understand why and what they are good for, doing this i am "always" going to be prepare to a new situation that i will face up.

Currently working as a frontend developer but on the day to day routine i have to be able to read, debug and change code on different languages, also as any other developer, some DEVOPS tasks as well. There i'm willing to learn everything i can, having experiences with different programming languages, systems architechtures and programming best practices.

My main focus when i am coding is to create user readable code and functional without any performance compromise.

If you want to contact me, dm me on any social media or matheus.g.silva@hotmail.com

I'm open for freelances and remote work as well!
